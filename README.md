​
Website for **Adams Porfolio** is used to display information about him to potential employers.
​
## What it consists of
Right now Its divided into 4 sections. A "Who" section that describes him. A "What" section that has links to current projects hes working on. A "Where hes been" section that will have an image and a expandable/printable resume. An last but not least a "where" to get ahold of him by email, phone, and general location.
